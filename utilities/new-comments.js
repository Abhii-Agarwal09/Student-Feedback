      "he isn't a great teacher by any meaning of the word. inside the class, he usually doesn't care much. sometimes comes to check whether we a re taking notes or not, but doesn't care too much about that either. his marking is average. he knows the subject is too lazy to teach. also, for subjects without project, he doesn't conduct quiz and DA for internals. he asks for a project and fucks over people there, so try not to take him for subjects which have projects unless as a last resort. if subject has a project, it doesn't matter and you can take him, if you want. not very strict and somewhat chill",

But one problem is he is very strict (Also don't allow to sleep or talking if he finds he won't let you to be in the class) . If you want to take him then make sure you take the previous class in the same building. ",

Overall, he is without a doubt a blacklist. Further proof is that in Cat1 more than 40 failed in a class of 54-56. Similar results in cat 2",

And u must copy down because he DOESN'T upload the ppt. He didn't upload until we all went and asked multiple times. So that's a problem. Another problem is that he teaches in class 'ABCD..' but in exam he asks for Shakespeare's poems (i.e) his PAT exams are usually tough unless u get the easy set among the many set of Question papers he makes. He is very strict in correcting and we don't even know why we lost marks. So that's 3 problems. Otherwise he is pretty ok. I'd suggest to take some other better faculty but if u take him, no need to panic cuz he isn't blacklist for sure. ",

Our batch submitted Coursera and most got 1-2. There were some who even submitted mathathon but GOT 0. Ask and confirm multiple times what she accepts as additional learning and then do so, if u need additional learning. She screwed over our entire batch at the end of semester by not giving marks for additional learning at all. All of us regretted submitting additional learning for her course while we could've used it for some other course, had we known she would screw us over at the end of sem.",

Has too much knowledge , his paper will be application oriented but if you've listened we'll in class piece of cake. Doesn't expect a page or 2 for 10 marks, says write 2 lines but the correct 2 points and that's legit. Take him, quizzes and DAs are also chill under him he'll give 10 to all. ",

      "Shit faculty. Notes are good as she dictates them in class. Teaching is average. And correction is horrible. She dont know how to correct at all. Wont give partial marks. I have taken her for DSA in sem 2 and she failed me, even though i was sure i'll pass. I then re-registered for it and got A grade lol, even though this time i didnt study half as much. On sem 3 I took her for DCCN and guess what i failed this time too. She didnt even correct my paper properly, she gave 0 marks in many questions where i wrote exactly she taught us. Two times i failed in VIT and both she was the faculty. She told she will take DAs J component style and we have to run around alot for giving review as she kept warding us off telling she dont have mood for it. JUST DONT TAKE HER AT ALL COST. BETTER GO WITH LESS CREDITS THAN TAKING HER.",

      "Took her as a first year in DLD, and looking back I would say easily one of the best teachers I have ever had in VIT. All the faculties should be respected for their years of experience in their fields, but not all faculties know how to impart that knowledge on to us inexperienced students. Ma'am is one of the faculties in VIT who do know how to, and that is why she earns your respect and admiration. Take here to get a good foundation in hardware subjects, will be helpful in microprocessors, system design and other subjects down the line. ",

      'Ok - so anyone reading this should know he is on the "blacklist" and is wondering if you should drop him or not. The correct option, no regrets - DROP HIM. He was assigned our Java faculty (CSE1007) after the original prof left (because no one took Shashikiran in ffcs so he was free), and all the seniors were terrified and protested so much that Dean IT came to class one day and had to promise us that CAT paper correction would be overseen by him so that no one would be failed (Shashikiran has a reputation of failing students). However no one oversaw FAT so people did fail. I was the only second year student who actually passed Java (with a B), the other three 2nd years kids failed. He is a bad and unreasonable person, which is why so many negative reviews. Strict, but at teaching he is ok. For some reason, he thinks Python is NOT a programming language and will argue with you about it if you mention it in class. His assignments for the lab have solutions on github, and people were able to cheat on the lab FAT at least, but that was because we had a chill lab assistant ',

The quizzes are really tough( there would be multiple sets so cheating is impossible in that little amount of time) even lab cats are quite difficult  . And he would force you to complete the  lab da in class itself! which is quite annoying imo . Two minutes late into the class and you are marked absent . Don't be surprised if you fail in the theory or lab component cause failing is common in his class . He is indeed a silent killer. Better opt for dharmendra instead.",

The minimum qualities that a teacher , an extremely average teacher ie , should have .... he has NONE, ABSOLUTELY NONE. He has already crossed the boundaries of humanity and basic decency, and he has absolutely no shame or respect. He will keep shouting at you like a dog , even if you just sit quietly for the entire team. His notes are worthless, his teaching style is worthless , his methods of teaching are apalling and he does not even give you marks properly. If I ever knew a teacher that was an utter failure, it is , without a doubt, HIM.  You might be thinking that i may be exaggerating, but this is  not just my opinion , it is the opinion of my entire class plus seniors . He was my teacher for FEC in my first semester and i swear to god, i had the worst time of my life. Even after this if you take him as your faculty, i don't have anything to say, you might the dumbest person amongst your peers.  ",

Can be approached easily anytime. Always replies to even the silliest and dumbest doubts and questions. His concept clarity is good too (more than enough for you to understand how to get a good score). I would highly recommend Bhagat sir, especially for CHY1701. Just a request, don't piss off such a nice man if you get into his class by doing some rubbish. ",

Not much teaching going on. But generally, he asks questions from his notes so his notes are okay. Also, he gives more marks and is lenient in correction. His DA's and quizzes are easy. For EVS he is the most preferred one.",

His notes are not that good. You should prefer some other faculty's notes. But his marking scheme is fine. If you write well you can get more than 40 in CAT and 80 in FAT. You can get a good grade if you study. Take him if he is the only option left. One interesting thing is sometimes he asks questions and if you answer them he gives you 10 marks extra in the final exam for sure.",

Had been wanting to take her since 2nd semester (DLD, CAO, Micro)- but she either got full or got changed to some other prof. Finally got her in 3rd year and 6th sem. A very polite and friendly teacher; no demands or attitude. Since the subject was new for her, so she also went on her own pace. Lenient correction in CATs, due to which average would be high. Missed an A by 1  mark. And DA1 is project based, so do that well-> suppose you get 9.5/10 for DA1, on the basis of this review scores would be given, especially for review 1. So if 9.5/10, then 19/20 for review 1, and so on. Please take her whenever you spot her, student-friendly, caring and knowledgeable she is.',

The first few classes he would be encouraging about teaching you the best and giving practice exercises, and also ask you to regularly work on the programs he teaches during classes. But in the later classes, he will later be absent or keep teaching from javatpoint- which is actually enough for the assessments and concepts. He wants output as well, for the programs in CAT- not just input. The lesson and mistake I learnt in CAT1, and no theoretical questions. However, be focused during the classes as sometimes during FAT, he would give questions from the class discussion. Never released marks on time and always released the marks, when they were freezed- so you could not change them or rectify. So write well. Got a dot A. Very moody sometimes, would shout unnecessarily, if you ask doubts. For free time, relaxed a lot :P but for learning and classes, not at all worth it. So if you take him, you are on your own. Just keep studying from javatpoint.',

Approachable for doubts, when free and easy to score S. Lost S as I made silly mistakes in CAT1, where maximum people scored. However, deciding factors are FAT (be regular during classes and learn the way she tells to, according to Question paper distribution, you will be able to score 90+) and quiz. Many lost marks here due to either time or silly mistakes. Only one thing I disliked about her was that 2 marks had been from each DA at the start itself- so even if you get full in quiz and CATs, 56/60 would be the highest before FAT. Otherwise take her- worth taking. Sadly she is very underrated- was lucky to have gotten her during add-drop in my 6th semester. Realistic grade range and fair checking- she would tell where and why she cut; later you would realize they are silly grammatical errors. Pl do take her whenever you notice- I feel she is much better than Shantanu (who I feel is overrated) and Calaivanane. ',

      'I had him for EVS in the 1st year, 1st semester. A very good and knowledgeable faculty he is. In the first class, he would appear strict but later, he would joke around and interact in a jovial manner. However, regarding the subject- he would make you actually study the subject, even if it is EVS and a 3-credit subject. So be regular, study well and from his notes, which are detailed and good enough. Also, make sure that quiz is being done on time- gives a 12 question quiz for around 6-7 minutes; would not budge if you ask him for a requiz on getting 0- on tech issues he may allow. His first assignment was a presentation and 2nd were a set of questions. If presentation goes well and the DA also is written well, decent marks would be awarded. When he distributes CAT papers, he would never carry a red pen- that much confidence he has in his correction; however, if total error, then he would give. Else, no grace marks. But worth taking.',

I mean, i've been a back-bencher my whole life and i am amazed! Her lectures are very hard to follow, you MIGHT score well if you've studied the whole night before or else forget that too. Don't expect any leniency from her in anything, ever. In conclusion, if you are certain that you are going to hell due to the countless sins you’ve made in this life and want to practice a bit, I recommend you take her. :) ",

      "He teaches well but he's the worst nightmare. I had him for DLD.  1) His DAs are super lengthy and he uploads them late. His DAs are so huge that you'll have to compress your file and send.  2) His question papers are equally lengthy and hard. It is lengthy even if you're really good in the subject. His corrections are strict beyond your imagination. 3) He is not friendly at all. He gets offended when someone talks about attendance or about how DAs are lengthy. He doesn't generally take students' opinion for quizzes too.  4) He teaches well but he's really fast in teaching. If you zone out for sometime, it's difficult to get back on track. Moreover, he takes the class for full one hour, sometimes the next class starts before he completes his class. 5) His notes are alright. They are understandable, but he doesn't upload on time sometimes. He skips uploading a few ppts too. You can't even ask. I pray for you if you have him.",

But Believe me if you join you can't left the class. He teaches in this level. Always takes care for students. Gopinath M.P, Akella Venkata and Dheeba J These three are superheroes of our VIT",

Even if somehow you had network issues, she'll just shake it off by saying \"it's not my problem\".  For J-comp, she literally wants you to make such a website nobody has seen before with zillions of features. She's not slightest of considerate of your work or your grades or marks. For lab-comp, she gives 2-hours deadline to make a full-fledged website with document submission within that 2-hr window only.  Humble request to everyone - Doesn't matter if you're 9-pointer or not, she's gonna fuck up your grades so hard that you may have to start planning about weekend semester before CAT-1 itself.",

      "First off, he gives decent marks in written exams (CATs, etc.).  Other than that, he's an apathetic shitfucker. Always high on opium, with very very high bp. Wouldn't listen to anyone in the class, wouldn't consider anything. Gives DAs in Moodle with plagiarism checker on, and WITHOUT any deadline. He'll turn off a DA whenever he feels like it, without informing.  If you start to reason with him, he'll bite your head off. Extremely strict in Lab exams. He'll set a timer of 1 hor 45 minutes, but will close the exam by 1 hr 30 minutes WITHOUT informing. If anyone asks a question in the class, which he's already answered someday, he'll start cursing you. It's not the regular fruity language, but coming from a faculty, anything of that tone hurts. That too in front of everybody.  I've no idea why the other reviews of him are decent; they're deceiving, to say the least. Thing is, he's always incredibly stressed, and takes it upon students all the damn time. If classes were offline and he continued to behave like what he did this online semester, someone would have shot him point-blank.  Overall verdict: take him if you have no other choice. you maybe will score decent marks, but your entire semester will be hell. your mental health, if any left, will go down the drain. Good luck.",

And he just does some important steps directly, which is hard to understand if you're doing that topic for the first time. But he does tell which question will come from what topic in CAT.  Don't take him if you have a choice, but if you do take him, your marks will not suffer if you learn using video lectures and see what questions he has done in his notes.",

It has been a great experience taking him, whether in terms of teaching, notes and marks. Just be honest and interested, do the work which he tells to, follow his rubrics and do the DAs honestly without any help from peers; he will treat you well and help whenever possible. In DSA and NASSCOM, got A in both- though in NASSCOM, missed S by 1 mark; so you can see, he does give marks in internals, and kind of the same to all in FATs, leading to such deviation in grades. Just be careful, alert and patient. Work load may be there, but at the end, it is worth it. Can be taken for any subject without doubt.',

Only problem I faced was in project, had to run to his cabin 10-12 times for documentation changes; unless and until doc is not good, he would not view your implementation.

She gives importance to discipline in classes (both theory and lab) and if you think you can flounder around and she would not notice & you would pass, then do not take her. Follow her rules well, be attentive in class, take notes properly and in lab- maintain a proper lab record as she desires, get it signed on time. She would admire, be genial & sweet and often help in problems. She is a very genial and good person; just be a front bencher (not totally front, the first 2 rows would do good) and reach on time. Follow her notes well, which are from Veerarajan and Anuradha- I had two subjects in the same slot; had this been independent, could have scored better in CATs and even quizzes (which are moderate to tough) & overall get a good grade. Nevertheless, she can be taken. Ignore the negative reviews given by those, who didn't follow the rules & rubrics when they took her; she is totally worth taking. Just be honest and have a no-nonsense attitude.",

Quiz will be tough and will have worst questions. Will have to make video explaning research paper and conference paper in the name of digital assignments. We had lab mid term test and lab fat on the same day and in same class. We did 4 lab assignments and a theory da and 2 quiz in lab fat week.The lab assignments, mtt,  lab fat had tough questions. Hardly took any lab class. For us, every lab class was theory class. Even after taking lab class as theory class, we had many extra classes.  Now you can decide.... at last its your call.....

Every Lab DA is like a Lab CAT which includes the implementation, a 5 mark quiz and you also have to share your screen to show the output. If you don't share your screen, you get 3/10 directly. If you share your screen and the output isn't correct, you get 1/5 for output and the remaining 5 marks are taken from the quiz. You get 10 only if you show the correct output and score 5/5 in the quiz. As far as the theory component is concerned, marking in CATs and DAs is really strict. He hardly gives more than 8 in any question and max 7 in the DAs. P.S. - These observations are from the online semesters.",

      'He’s by the far the best teacher i had in my life and honestly, i’d never seen nobody shine the way he does. It’s one thing to teach really well and an entirely different thing to teach whilst simultaneously inspiring and enticing curiosity in your students. He really gets into why we learn the subject and tries his best to go beyond the concepts and what’s required of him to teach. Faculty are usually concerned with completing their work early and cancelling classes at the end of the semester. But, sunil sir has taught us everyday until the very last one and hasn’t even taken a single leave. Coming to the curiosity part, he made me fall in love with the subject. It never felt like i was studying when i was going through the classes or the reference books he gave us, i actually enjoyed it. In other aspects like doubt clearing and friendliness, he’s brilliant there too. He could just go on teaching, but instead chooses to constantly ask us questions and check if we’re following. He’s created an environment in the class where in people aren’t hesitant to ask doubts, no matter how silly. There was an instance where a student ending up being correct, he’d gladly accepted the error and fixed it in the very next class. He’s also made an official WhatsApp group where he reminds us of DA submissions, quiz timings and syllabus. He also constantly checks his messages and replies as soon as he can. At the end of the day, it is very life affirming to know that teachers like him exist and i’d choose him in a heart beat if i find him in the FFCS list again.',

      "(Worst) * Infinite!!! I had got him for Machine Learning (ML- CSE4020); earlier, I had taken Vijayarajan V for this subject- but since he became the HoD of the IoT department, Naveen Kumar N took over. The worst professor I ever had in my engineering life- in the likes of Rahul Raman, Ananda Kumar S, Chandra Mohan B and Lydia Jane G. Doesn't know the subject, which he himself admitted. Never took proper classes- instead, he always gave class activities, which I thought would help increase total or some weightage would come at the end; once in a blue moon, he taught in theory. But in lab, utter stupidity. No demos or teaching of concepts, straight away lab exercises, that too complex ones- for which he would give even complicated links. Also, if you are this chill student, who thinks can copy DAs or modify and then submit, avoid him completely. Even a slight plagiarism, which may also be due to some students and you referring the same site for reference, loss of marks is guaranteed. For instance, I did not copy assignments, but yet I got 2 out of 7 or 8, as my DA was found similar to one or two students. Also, strict correction in CATs. The level of papers he has given in CATs or FAT will never be enough to complete. In CATs, he did not even bother to give marks for steps. Gave below 20 in both CATs. And in FAT, I could solve 5 questions, that too at the nick of time. Such lengthy papers he gives to solve. This is my final year- and given the stress about placements, and also carrying along a subject like Microprocessor along, this was terrorizing and draining. Luckily, will be passing his course, just waiting for the grades. But do avoid this guy, if you wanna save your grades and later career. Don't get misguided by the reviews of seniors/friends who recommend him, and also here- someone has written a positive feedback about him. Either he must have self studied and scored, or did not know till FAT happened. :P NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED!!! God save you if anyone took him for a subject....",

You definitely need to refer other materials of other faculties, take help from friends and seniors and refer tutorials like YouTube from module 1 to 7 to pass that course.

      "I had studied Theory of Computation and Compiler Design (ToC- CSE2002) in the 3rd semester. A very good, knowledgeable & one of the underrated professors of VIT. He never taught with a PPT, rather- he explained the concept, sketched & wrote on the board, and practiced the sums based on the concepts. If you are alert and listen to his classes, his notes and explanations are enough for CATs. However, his quiz was difficult to crack. Highest was I think 6/10 for the morning slot, and DA was a project, which is huge to work on and many proposed a common topic for it, later he accepted for the entire class. His correction in CATs is fair and genuine; a plus point is that, irrespective of how much you got, he tends to increase everyone's marks by +5- provided you solve the entire paper again neatly in A4 sheets using Black & Blue pens with margins. If any of those are missing, then +3 or +4- but increase is guaranteed, thereby increasing the average. Also, for FATs, notes won't be enough as the subject is broad, need to be prepared for variations in questions. So, watch the playlist of Neso Academy on YouTube; helps big time. No idea about correction of FATs, as at our time, papers were being shuffled and going to different professors for correction, so my paper was checked by someone else, because of whom I just passed. But overall, a great learning experience under this professor. Can be taken for any subject, wherever he is spotted.",

It so happened that during Lab FAT, I got Optical Fiber, which is one of the toughest experiments. So, during setup, I asked him for a small help. He said he would help but in the next semester (summer semester), indicating that he would fail me. Crossed my tabular columns even though they were correct.

A very experienced professor he is, having done MSc and PhD from SUTD (Singapore University of Technology & Design) and France. Heavily research-oriented and if you listen to his classes, it is really good to listen as he explains concepts in depth & with applications. Very approachable for any problems or queries. I remember that some of my friends and I were not able to submit the quiz for this subject, even though we pressed on time. We approached Sir, he called us to the cabin and asked for a solution. He later agreed for a re-quiz, knowing that it was the first time or there was a technical glitch. His correction in CATs may seem strict, but he actually looks for depth and well-explained answers; he had this grudge against the Anuradha book xD. If you study his notes, well-detailed are and will help you achieve a good score, just that you need to be regular and daily study those notes as they are really long. While writing answers, be descriptive and draw diagrams well, even for the smallest of the units. His correction is moderate in cats, and quiz is doable. DAs are a bit tough, and be regular on submissions- he will cut marks if he finds that you uploaded on time in Schoology, but uploading on the last day of submission on VTOP. Overall, recommended for the concepts and teaching, but for scoring- you need to give time and study well.',

A very good and knowledgeable professor he is, who knows the concepts and does his best to teach in the class. You just have to be regular in his classes and study daily, else you will lose track and it becomes tough to follow-up and understand the concepts during self-study. His labs are in such a way, that the whole class gets divided into groups of 4 (it may be 3 or 5, depending on the strength of class) in order of the registration number, and then you have to perform the experiments, take down the readings & get it signed by the prof. His correction in CATs is fine to moderate. How much ever you write, he gives for those answers only. Same for the lab records and tests. Only things I did not like were his quizzes, which were tough to crack due to short time and DA, which was project based. Else, he can be taken without doubt for electrical-based subjects.',

She teaches well and does her best to maintain a healthy environment during classes. Can be taken for grasping and understanding the subject, but for marks and grade- you need to put efforts.',

      "Worst of all time!!! Arrogant, worst, pathetic, disgusting, strict etc.- words are less to describe this guy. I had him for Digital Logic and Design (DLD- CSE1003) in the 1st year, 2nd semester. Those who are telling that they understood concepts well, I would like to ask what concept you remember- pl comment again and tell those?! Taught absolutely nothing, tough and painful assessments (CATs, quizzes [who keeps a subjective quiz or cross word of 25 to 30 questions and 60 to 65 different sets, means different set for each student; i mean ideally 5 to 6 is fine- that shows his joblessness], lab FATs, DAs etc.). He never gave the papers in CATs after correction, just uploaded the marks on vtop and asked us to come to his cabin to see the answer scripts, but when we went- he is not there. Lab DAs and its correction are a pain too, and in lab FATs, he would take 45 minutes to arrange the class in order, and only remaining 45 minutes we got to solve the question, which itself was an application-based and a tricky one, which required time to understand. Horrendous ego issues this guy has- if you wish him or greet him, doesn't even greet you back; rather, tosses his head up and walks away. It feels so good that such pseudos have left VIT, and the upcoming batches have been saved from this monster!!!",

      "I had him for Introduction to Innovative Projects (IIP- PHY1999) in the 1st year, 2nd semester. A sadistic and non-friendly professor, who made the subjects even like IIP a run-for-the-marks subject. His DAs, apart from SWAT analysis, were all art-n-craft based, not at all worth it. However, I was lucky to have a team in which one had him has the physics professor, another's friend got him previously for IIP. So in DAs, showed time-to-time and uploaded accordingly, and he gave fine marks. Real test comes in project; for review 2, my group got 20/30- when we asked him for consideration, he said he would give 30 if his colleagues liked it; else, 3/30. His class ethics are horrible too, never respects any student or their problems, and maybe girls. Wants you to be there at dot time or 5 to 10 mins late. Not wearing ID Card and watch classifies you as a beggar in front of him. Where others were getting at least A (profs gave min A, and S majority got), in this guy's class- grades have reached upto C or D, as they were many who weren't able to upload due to VTOP or network issues, straight away 0. No consideration for mails. I survived solely on the group, and those who knew his correction and evaluation rubrics. AVOID THIS GUY- if you wanna live a good life.",

      'I had her for Software Engineering (SE- CSE3001) in the 4th semester. She is one knowledgeable professor in VIT, who does know the subject and teaches well. Her notes are good too, to study for the assessments. Only problem is the laboratory at my time. She made it project-based and as single project, making it tough to survive the lab as each DA was related to the lab project. Also, very frank about DAs, she gave as low as 1/10 if it did not meet the format, and high expectations in project. Quizzes are of tough to moderate level and application-based, so you need to be regular in classes. DA in theory is doable. Overall, if you want to learn the subject, take her; else, for scoring, loads of efforts will be required.',

      'I had her for Network and Communication (NetComm- CSE1004) in the 4th semester. She is a knowledgeable professor and teaches well in class. However, scoring is tough in internals. CATs correction are moderate to tough, as either people are just around or above the average. Her quizzes are tough too, as short time but application-level and tough questions are to be done. You have to be regular in her classes apart from self study through notes and tutorials. Labs are manageable, not a problem. Decent marks are awarded. For additional learning, other than NPTEL, she would not accept anything. I had a certificate, which was a merger between a particular site and NPTEL. After convincing and mails, she accepted, and that helped get a B grade. In my class, apparently only one got S, few As, and majority Bs- in which many missed A by one or two marks. So, for learning and understanding of concepts- take her. Else, easy scoring and chill environment is not possible. I had missed a class, she refused to give attendance- contrary to those who said attendance she gives easily. :P',

Teaches and speaks in a low voice, his classes are very boring, can make you sleepy. His corrections are also terrible and if you go to his cabin and argue with him regarding it, he would cut 1 or 2 marks on the face. His quizzes are an absolute pain. DA even tougher. So if you take this guy, not only the subject- but the entire winter sem will go crazy and troublesome. A random and stupid prof he is.',

      "I had her for Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory (MAT1014). Brilliant and truly popular for her teaching and other perks. Will take classes for no longer than 25 to 30 minutes, teach the concept and give practice sums. Her practice sums are very beneficial. Be regular in her classes everyday and follow those, it would help you score amazingly. Also, she helps gives marks and keeps increasing when you ask her- something I failed to capitalize in. :P  But liberal in checking overall. Quiz is also of an easy level, covering the basic rules and definitions, rather than problems or something out-of-the-box. DAs are doable and great marks awarded. But if you are planning to take her, you need to put extra efforts to stay above average, as many 9 pointers and seniors take her. At my time, S was at 99. :P; I got B at 87. :')  so you can imagine her grade range, how high it can go up to. But a true 'Devi', take her- the subject is set and you will pass with at least B; for a top grade, sincere efforts would have to be put by you as well.",

Teaches the concepts well and is friendly to all, unless you follow discipline and don't use mobile in class- he strictly abhors those who talk or use mobile in class. His correction in CATs are moderate and in DAs too. In lab, he would be helpful if you experience any problems while performing an experiment. Only that be punctual and on time to get the experiments signed. Overall, a very good professor, can be taken for this subject.",

      "I had him for Digital Forensics (CSE4004) in the 4th semester. Rather, he got placed in place of Aju D. He doesn't know the subject, which he himself admitted. His theory classes were boring, used to come to classes 15 to 20 minutes late, and would just show random videos or case studies for teaching. He did not teach anything in lab, rather we taught each other in labs through different softwares; we had done 10-15 softwares without him teaching, he would just see who are talking in class or using mobiles & threaten them. Marks were decently given, however convincing him for extra marks is a task. But he ended up screwing grades as he gave preferences to seniors who did research papers for additional learning, and there were quite a bunch. His DA in theory is pretty long, would randomly give marks for that. So, not recommended. Don't take him, it would be stressful.",

I had to do grade improvement as I got a back, so took him as he was new and others were full at that time. I was in the first batch of his class, like he had newly joined at that time. A very friendly professor he is, and I am glad that I took him for AoD as it helped me save my grade big time and also, he teaches well. He tends to teach the concept and the rule/theorem involved in depth and with example, before proceeding to the problems. His DAs are lengthy, but doable. He takes 2 quizzes, but 2nd quiz is tougher. Correction is fair and genuine. If found that an increase is required, he would increase. I still remember that I had scored pretty less in CAT2, but later when I checked V-TOP, he increased it by a good margin. He also gave marks for additional learning for participating in Hackathons or Mathathons, based on the level of participation or till the level which we participated. Overall, a very good professor and recommended for any Maths-related subject.',

      "My luck has really been bad in terms of subjects like IIP or LSM, as I have never been able to get easy-going professors and DAs. I had taken him for Lean Start-Up Management (LSM- MGT1022) in the 6th semester. An absolutely obnoxious and terrible guy he is, biggest mistake of taking him during add-drop. Every class is a review day for him. Not at all understanding or cooperative. Strict plagiarism checker, rejects projects right away if he finds the project to be similar or of no innovation. Even for a subject like LSM, he made us work till no end. Our review 2 he rejected as he thought we copied, so we had to redo it, with a lengthy PPT- after which he accepted. Review 3 went well, as we actually implemented simulation and a VR feature. In spite of all the efforts and actually making a technical project- which was initially an ideation or a prototype only, he only gave 79 in project, with him telling that the project was lacking focus- what a prick. It ended being one of my lowest scores, instead of highest. Don't even take him by mistake. Scraped an A somehow, and also, differentiates in total by giving one DA as individual, whereas others were group-based; never got this logic. Also, he is so absent-minded, that a friend of mine got B and other mates of his got A as he got low scores by mistake. NEVER EVER TAKE HIM; even if you don't get LSM till 8th semester, stay back for an extra semester and do it under an amazing prof. NEVER EVER MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID, a request and warning at the same time....",

Good if you are alert and awake. Never considers reasons from students. It so happened that I lost my grandfather just before CAT1, and I had a DA to submit. I had submitted on VTOP. But I gave it late, telling him that since I was not able to go for the last rites, I would not be able to focus for some days. First he said OK, but later, he gave only 6/10. When asked, he said you did not even go for the funeral; why should I consider a late submission? I tried reasoning with him, but he did not budge. Hard af quizzes as well!!! Don't take him, not all recommended. Overrated and Overhyped for some reasons....",
